### How I managed states in my project
    For every state used in project, I declared a hook named useState from react. 
    We know that it returns an array of two things. One of them is state-variable and other one is a function to change the state-variable. State-variable is used to set a variable in front-end, did I so.
    After that, I used the function returned from the useState hook where I had to change the variable.
